# ECE 1779 - Introduction to Cloud Computing
This is my work primarily to complete a project-based _University of Toronto graduate course ECE1779_ in which a combination of lectures and hands-on programming assignments expose the student to the leading cloud computing paradigms and programming interfaces (e.g., EC2, App Engine). 
To see complete explanation about the course please refer to the following link:

## Assignments
All programming assignments in this course are targeted to the  python and flask platform:
- Assignment1 provides some experience with: 
    1. Developing a web application using python and flask.
    2. Deploying and running your application on Amazon EC2.
    3. Experince working with AWS technologies: EC2, S3, CloudWatch, and Load Balancing.
    4. Report for this assignment is avilable at:  https://github.com/farshadsafavi/Cloud-Computing/blob/master/Assignment1/Assignment1Report.pdf
- Assignment2 provides some experience with: 
    1. Amazon technologies: Lambda, API Gateway, and Dynam
    2. All application data is persistently stored on DynamoDB and S3.
    3. The backend logic is implemented using Lambda functions.
    4. Report for this assignment is avilable at:  https://github.com/farshadsafavi/Cloud-Computing/blob/master/Assignment2/Assignment2Report.pdf

## Final Project 
Developed an android and web application which  track daily habits of students and persistently stored on DynamoDB and S3. Both mobile and web application share backend logic which is implemented using Lambda functions.
